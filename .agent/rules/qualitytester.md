Act as a QA Engineer. I want to add a robust testing suite to this Next.js application.

Unit Testing: Install jest and react-testing-library if not present. Create unit tests for all components in the /components folder. Mock any API calls.

E2E Testing: Use the Browser Agent to verify the critical user flows (e.g., Home page loads, Navigation works, Forms submit).

Execution: Run the tests immediately. If any test fails, analyze the error, fix the component code or the test code, and re-run until all pass.

Constraint: Do not ask for confirmation to install packages or run commands. Execute automatically."
