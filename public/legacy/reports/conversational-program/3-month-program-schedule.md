## Notes for Teachers

⚠️ **Important Reminders:**
- Keep sentences SHORT and SIMPLE (3-5 words max)
- Use PICTURES and GESTURES for new vocabulary
- Practice REPETITION - students need to hear words many times
- Allow MISTAKES - focus on communication, not perfection
- Use REAL objects when possible (real menu, real clothes, etc.)

ℹ️ **Flexibility:**
Teachers can adjust the pace based on student progress. Some topics may need more time.
